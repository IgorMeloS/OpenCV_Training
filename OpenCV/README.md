# Computer Vision Training

This folder contains a part of my personal training in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Computer Vision. Here, I present two folders, the first a Computer Vision module (pipeline) that allows to build some of the most important Convolution Neural Networks (CNNâ€™s), beyond the module, I present also some cases of study, applying many models with the module. All the dataset are the standard found in the Kaggle platform. The second folder contains some OpenCV  skills. As we know, this library is extremely important to the computer vision tasks.

If you want to see the contents of the computer vision module, [click here](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/ComputerVision%20Module). If you want navigate inside the OpenCV folder, [click here](https://github.com/IgorMeloS/Computer-Vision-Training/tree/main/OpenCV).
