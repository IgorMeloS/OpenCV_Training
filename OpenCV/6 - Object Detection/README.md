# Object Detection with OpenCV

The templates come from [Learn OpenCV](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/PyTorch-faster-RCNN) and [PyImageSearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/). The video for demonstration was grabbed on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDxUZhTgoto).

# Three object detection model

We load the Faster R-CNN, SSD and YOLOv3 trained model on COCO dataset. To perform detection, we build a detector to each model.
